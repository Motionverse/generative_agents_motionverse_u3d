Before you run the demo scene, follow these steps:

Built-in render pipeline:
1. Install the Post Processing package from the Package Manager
2. Set the Color Space to Linear (Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings)
3. (Optional) Set the Suntail settings as default (Suntail Village > Demo > Settings)

URP:
1. Set the Color Space to Linear (Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings)
2. Unpack the URP package from the "SRP Packages" folder
3. Set the "SuntailUniversalRenderPipelineAsset" as default or keep your own (Edit > Project Setiings > Graphics > Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings)

If you want to change the render pipeline back to Built-In, just unpack the "Built-In" package from the "SRP Packages" folder. If some materials turn pink, just restart Unity.

If you have any problems, feel free to email contact@raygeas.com

Thank you for purchasing Suntail!
